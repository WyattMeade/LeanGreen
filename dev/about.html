				<p>The tale behind this venture started out tragic and, ultimately, ended in sweet redemption. Our fearless founder, Brian Lucas, used to be fat. Like okra fat. He was stuck in a corporate job that offered long, thankless hours with zero regard for personal nutrition. On several occasions when Brian was tirelessly working late at his desk, he was forced to grab dinner from a depressing vending machine in the office break room. His choices were always the same.

And, as for Brian, his gut is now gone and he lives by the namesake of his company, Leangreen Healthy Vending.</p>
